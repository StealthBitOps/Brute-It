## 🧨 Brute It

---
#### 🧭 Objectives
- Learn how brute-force attacks work in practice.
- Use Hydra to target login forms and services.
- Understand the importance of wordlists and protocol selection.

#### 🧠 Skills Explored
- Brute-forcing SSH and HTTP login credentials.
- Crafting and customising Hydra commands.
- Selecting appropriate wordlists and attack modes.
- Interpreting output and validating successful logins.

#### 🛠️ Tools Overview
- `Hydra` – Fast and flexible brute-force tool.
- `rockyou.txt` – Common password wordlist.
- TryHackMe target VM – Services with login interfaces.

#### 🔄 Steps to Remember (_Brute-Force Flow_)
1. **Identify Target** – Choose service and login endpoint.
2. **Select Wordlist** – Use or modify dictionary files.
3. **Run Hydra** – Configure flags for protocol and credentials.
4. **Monitor Output** – Detect successful login attempts.
5. **Access & Confirm** – Log in and verify credentials.
